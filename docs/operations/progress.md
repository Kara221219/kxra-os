# KXRA OS implementation progress

Updated: 25 September 2026. Status: **Phase 2 Slice 8 is implemented and verified with deterministic local evidence. The system is not deployed or production ready.**

Current branch: `codex/phase-2-completion`. Slice 8 starts from pushed Slice 7 commit `4d7c1679ecb3296247e2f637cccf8e61d9c77649`, which descends from the reviewed Genesis implementation. The branch is not merged. No default-branch change, production deployment, provider activation, external send, candidate-code execution or publication occurred.

The cumulative contract remains [Phase Completion Brief 02](CODEX-PHASE-COMPLETION-BRIEF-02.md), the earlier [Phase Completion Brief](CODEX-PHASE-COMPLETION-BRIEF.md), the [Final Completion Brief](../../KXRA-FINAL-COMPLETION-BRIEF.md) and the private Genesis source. Later requirements supplement earlier requirements. Executable status is recorded in [acceptance evidence](acceptance-evidence.md).

## Completed in Slice 8

- Added independent `apps/marketing` and separate production build with every current and preserved public route.
- Added an exact SHA-256-bound `REVIEW_REQUIRED` public snapshot. Publication, indexing and legal activation remain disabled.
- Added original semantic layered storytelling with desktop depth, mobile recomposition, reduced-motion, 320 px, 200% text and no-JavaScript fallbacks.
- Added contact, enquiry and custom-project forms with exact-origin/schema/body checks, honeypot discard, HMAC request digests, idempotency, daily duplicate suppression and transactional hourly rate limiting.
- Added owner-only `UNVERIFIED` public enquiry records, audit events and a private Idea Inbox view. Anonymous and partner reads remain empty under RLS.
- Added public/private source and artifact scanners, ADR 0015, a public-site threat model and staging/release playbook.

## Cumulative verified implementation

- Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript with PostgreSQL as authorization and state authority.
- 57 ordered additive migrations, 153 RLS-protected tables with explicit policies and 122 audited public functions.
- 122 database/domain/HTTP tests, 42 private-OS browser scenarios (38 passes/four intentional skips) and 10 public-site browser scenarios.
- Database/private-object restart persistence, both optimized production builds, exact snapshot/source-boundary checks, 21-marker artifact exclusion and a 279-file publication/secret scan pass.
- Invitation/account lifecycle, selected-tenant legal gate, owner control plane, seven venture workspaces, file/knowledge lifecycle, permission-safe local Ask/AI execution, deterministic commercial/custom-project foundations and Brand Studio remain green in one hermetic run.

Definitions, schemas, disabled controls and local provider doubles are not counted as connected capabilities.

## Acceptance status for this slice

- **AT-17 PASS locally:** applications build independently; required routes use one exact snapshot; private-source/marker scans pass; publication remains disabled.
- **AT-26 PASS locally:** all three forms validate, bot-check, deduplicate, rate-limit and store one owner-only unverified audited row; `/login` targets the private app.
- **AT-44 PASS locally:** desktop/mobile, reduced motion, 320 px, 200% text, keyboard and no-JavaScript scenarios pass. Production-like Lighthouse/Web Vitals and representative screen-reader review remain release checks.
- **AT-45 PARTIAL / local boundary PASS:** source and both build artifacts exclude planted private markers. Hosted RSC/prefetch/cache/error isolation remains unverified.

## Remaining work

### Partial

- Brand Studio: remote source refresh, media generation, provider queues, sector claim policies and publication remain absent.
- Identity/legal: hosted Supabase Auth/MFA/pooler, real owner bootstrap and solicitor-approved legal content remain unverified.
- Commercial: Stripe products/prices, checkout, webhook, portal and approved billing policies remain disconnected.
- Custom projects: owner triage/proposal/change-control and customer milestone/payment UX remain incomplete.
- AI/files: external OpenAI dispatch, production Storage/scanning/extraction, paid budgets and distributed recovery remain incomplete.
- Projects 006/007: provider/scanner adapters remain intentionally disabled.
- Routines: no always-on scheduler, Trigger.dev task, hosted worker or notification delivery adapter is connected.
- WhatsApp: no registered Meta webhook, credential/token custody, provider media fetch, production scan/transcription, model call or outbound send is connected.

### Missing

- Connected staging providers, telemetry, backup/restore evidence, production performance/accessibility evidence, approved public/legal content, release evidence and first-customer rehearsal.

## Active owner and external inputs

- Qualified UK solicitor approval for exact NDA/confidentiality, Terms, Privacy, cookie, AI/data-processing and custom-project documents.
- Customer discovery decisions for initial segment, launch plan, plan limits, the approximately £30 pricing hypothesis, free-partner policy and custom-project terms.
- Entity/public contact details, retention/recovery targets, support/privacy mailboxes and approved public copy/brand assets.
- Later staging credentials and budgets through provider secret stores, never chat or Git.
- When the YouTube slice is connected: a Google Cloud project, YouTube Data API, OAuth consent configuration and the exact Finance Unfolded channel-authorized account.
- When repository analysis is connected: approved archive source, production scanner/SBOM/SAST services and an isolated no-network sandbox design.

These inputs do not block continued local work with synthetic fixtures and disabled adapters.

## Next safe action

Commit and push Slice 8, confirm GitHub Actions, then begin Final Milestone 10 production quality: safe telemetry adapters, CSP/rate-limit hardening, empty-target backup/restore evidence, dependency/SAST gates and broader failure/accessibility/performance coverage. Keep deployment and publication disabled.

## Publication boundary

Only application code, engineering documentation and minimum classified seed records required by the platform may enter the repository. Original Word/text sources, private Genesis research, the private business pack, archives, `.runtime`, credentials, screenshots, traces, databases/object backups and generated test artifacts remain excluded.
